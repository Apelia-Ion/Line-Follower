<summary>Project Description</summary>
<br>
The goal of this project is to design and build a line following robot that can navigate a pre-defined path using infrared sensors and DC motors. The final course must be finished in 20s or less.
The robot had to be built and coded from scratch, using the line-follower kit recieved from the robotics lab. In order to follow the line properly, we had to implement a PID algorithm. For the coding part, our team used mostly an emphiric approach, but we also tried to implement a PID control function which should have changed the PID values, according to the plant.
